INTRODUCTION 
In this project, you will apply what you have learned in the course (e.g., github usage, C/C++ programming, etc.) and 
implement a text-based mini-game of your own choice. A text-based game is a console application that can be 
accessed using the Linux terminal and via SSH. Please pay attention to the project requirements, scope, and 
submission details in this instruction. You have the flexibility to work on your own idea as long as your final program 
comprises the element as set out in the code requirement below.

REQUIREMENTS 
• Code Requirement: Your implementation should include all the following coding elements: 
o Generation of random events 
o Data structures for storing data 
o Dynamic memory management 
o File input/output (e.g., for loading/saving data) 
o Program codes in multiple files 
o Multiple Difficulty Levels: The game should have more than one difficulty level, allowing the player 
to choose their preferred level. 
• Documentation and Code style: 
o In-code documentation: For each function, comments on “what it does”, “what the inputs are”, and 
“what the outputs are” are needed. 
o Proper indentation and naming styles should be used to ensure readability and maintainability. 
o All project files should be committed to a private GitHub repo. Commit comments should not be 
empty and should be written sensibly. 
o README.MD: Include team members, application description, features, non-standard libraries, and 
compilation/execution instructions. 
the grader won't download any libraries from the internet for you, and your program will be considered not 
compilable because of missing dependencies. To use a library that requires additional installation, you 
should either put the necessary files from a library together with your code so that an additional installation 
is not needed, or you shouldn't use the library at all. 
• You should make sure your code can be successfully compiled in the Computer Science department's 
academy server.

Stage 1:
What to do for this milestone:
To set up a private GitHub repo where your work will be hosted.
 Set up a private Github repository that includes all group members and the teaching team account 
engg1340comp2113. 
• You can refer to Inviting collaborators to a personal repository GitHub Docs for the procedure to add 
collaborators. 
• The teaching team will accept the invitation within 7 days. If we fail to do so, please add again.

Stage 2:
• In the same Github repo that you set up in Stage 1. 
o Create a README.MD file in the repo that contains: 
▪ Identification of the team members. 
▪ A description of your game. 
▪ A list of features that you have implemented and explain how each coding element 1 to 5 listed 
under the coding requirements aforementioned support your features. 
▪ A list of non-standard C/C++ libraries, if any, that are used in your work and integrated to your 
code repo. Please also indicate what features in your game are supported by these libraries. 
▪ Compilation and execution instructions. This serves like a "Quick start" of your game. The 
teaching team will follow your instructions to compile and run your game. 
o Your code including the makefile and all source files (.h / .cpp) 
• Submit a link to the repo to Moodle. (Refer to the details on the submission page)
